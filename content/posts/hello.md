134,470,447 \$ were digitally stolen solely from Australia according to
their government. Now imagine a bigger scenario, millions of dollars are
being stolen on the internet from lay people every year. How is this
being achieved? Scamming on the internet.\
\
**What is scamming\
\
Scamming:** To scam means to swindle someone of their resources by the
use of underhanded tactics. Cyber Scamming, likewise, means to scam
someone digitally. It is carried out by a number of means that we will
discuss later in this article.\
\
In this article we will discuss scamming, its types and methods and how
*you* can protect yourself from being scammed.\
\
In this world where the impact of internet and its users are higher than
ever, the chances of you being scammed are also significantly higher.
The internet has taken so much over this world that even if you are not
directly connected to the internet, you can still fall victim to
scamming. So, a person is required to have ample knowledge about the
internet to not get scammed.\
\
**Background:** Scamming history not only predates the concept of
internet but the digitally world itself, people were scammed by other
people in the street and alleyways but the rise and availability of the
internet to the has provide the scammers more means and a bigger pool of
potential victims. Cherry on the cake is the anonymity offered by the
internet, it is nearly impossible to find a digital scammer.
Consequently, scamming on the internet is growing by manifolds and it
has became a den of internet scammers.\
\
**Types of Scams Targeting Young People:\
\
**There are multiple types of scams and new scams are being created by
devilish minds everyday, but we will only look at the scam you will
encounter generally and frequently. The scams that have the most
victims.\
\
**Phishing Scams:** These are the type of scam in which a scammer
usually impersonate a trusted company or firm and deceive you into
giving sensitive information. This can include a fake company call, an
email pretending to be from a your bank account or it can even be your
friends that fell victim to a scam and their social media is now
hijacked and being used to create more victims. Let us have a look on
this example:\

height="1.5486111111111112in"} In this picture, we can clearly see how a
friend has been hijacked and is making this fake statement, that he/she
has accidentally reported your account to Discord and you are at a
potential risk of being banned. The give away here is how he/she is
referring to a specific Discord agent, but actual Discord Inc. does not
provide any agents. This emphasizes that you you have to know about the
things you use on the internet.\
\
\
There are other versions to it where you receive a random message from
an unknown number citing that your credit card has been blocked and to
re-activate it, provide your bank account info. Once you do it, your
credit card will actually be blocked due to the suspicious activities
carried out on it and your card will be emptied. How to prevent it? We
will talk about it in a second in *Prevention and Protection* section.

\
**Social Media Scams:** Fake giveaways, fraudulent profiles and
misleading advertisements have become a commonplace in social media
platforms like Facebook, Whatsapp, Instagram, X, Reddit, only to name a
few. Fake giveaways make you think that you have won some lucrative
prize but you need to pay a small fee to accept it. Even if you pay the
fee you will never receive the prize. Fraudulent profiles are fake
profiles of some influential person that can be abused in a number of
ways. Misleading advertisements lead you to some fishy website that
install viruses on your device to steal personal information.\
\
**Fake Job Offers:** Unemployed or needy people will often fall to the
trick of fake job offers. Predominantly, you will be approached for
employment offering decent salary with low to minimum workload. If you
show interest then you will be asked for personal information or an
upfront fee for training. You guessed it, they will just disappear in
the blues after gaining this information.\
\
**Online Shopping Scams:** Fraudulent sellers and shopping website will
make young buyers to pay hefty price for a product just never arrives or
is not as described. For example, a person buys a beautiful dress for
300\$ but he receives a low quality 50\$ shirt. These are very common on
the internet and a thing to look out for.\
\
**Why People Fall for Scams\
\
**\
**Lack of Experience:** People new to the internet world are more
vulnerable to scams than experienced users who might have encountered
similar scams before. So, experience is an important factor.\
**Overconfidence in Digital Literacy:** Some people, especially
tech-savvy people may believe that they know enough about the internet
to not fall prey to scam. However, in face of new scam techniques
over-confidence can be fatal and may ultimately make you a victim. That
is why it is necessary to stay updated on new tech-related news and
information and our blog posting provides just the right outlet for you.

\
**Lack of Digital Knowledge:** Lack of digital knowledge means you are a
potential victim because you can easily be social engineered to trust
wrong people.\
\
**Real-Life Examples\
**

**Jane\'s Story:** Jane, a college student, lost \$500 to a fake job
offer she found online. She was promised a high-paying remote job, but
after providing her bank details for \'direct deposit,\' her account was
emptied. Jane\'s story is the perfect exploitation of needy people.

**Mike\'s Encounter:** Mike was excited about a giveaway he saw on
Instagram. After sharing his personal details and credit card
information to claim his \'prize,\' he discovered unauthorized charges
on his account. This example shows how easily scammers can exploit
social media platforms to deceive users.

**Impact of Scams on People\
\
**People who are just starting their journey financially or are
financially unstable, after getting scammed, may become monetarily weak.
Furthermore, people may start to distrust the internet world. Being
skeptical towards every other good legitimate opportunity is a commonly
observed behavior of scam victims. It is also a shame and stigma if you
get scammed, you get laughed at and considered a foolish person. The
emotional impact, including stress and embarrassment can also be
detrimental.\
**\
Prevention and Protection\
**To prevent scams you should be cautious about sharing your personal
information and here are some tips for you:\
\
**Verify Legitimacy:** Always check the legitimacy of websites, job
offers, and online stores. Look for reviews and official contact
information. Discuss it with related community.

**Be Skeptical of Too-Good-To-Be-True Offers:** If an offer seems too
good to be true, it probably is. Take the time to research and verify
before making any commitments.

information through unsecured channels. Use strong passwords and enable
two-factor authentication where possible. This is the most important tip
